# QuizReward Smart Contract





## Project Title
**Micro-rewards for Quiz Completions**

## Project Description
The **QuizReward** smart contract is designed to distribute ERC-20 token rewards to users upon completing quizzes. This contract enables a decentralized, transparent, and automated reward system for quiz platforms. Platform owners (admins) can fund the contract with tokens and reward users for completing quizzes, ensuring a fair and secure incentive mechanism for engagement. The contract includes features to fund the reward pool, track individual rewards, and manage withdrawals of unclaimed funds by the contract owner.

## Project Vision
The vision of the **QuizReward** project is to provide a gamified and rewarding experience for users who participate in quizzes. By integrating blockchain technology and ERC-20 tokens, the platform can ensure transparency, security, and fair distribution of rewards, incentivizing users to participate more actively in quizzes and educational content. This will help create a robust ecosystem where users are directly rewarded for their engagement.

## Key Features

### 1. **Automated Reward Distribution**
   - Users are rewarded with ERC-20 tokens automatically when they complete a quiz.
   - The reward process is fully automated through the smart contract.

### 2. **Reward Tracking**
   - The contract maintains a record of rewards earned by each user.
   - Users can view the total rewards they have accumulated.

### 3. **Owner Funding Mechanism**
   - The contract owner (admin) can fund the contract with ERC-20 tokens to ensure there are enough tokens available for rewards.
   - Only the owner has the permission to fund the contract.

### 4. **Transparency and Security**
   - The reward distribution process is transparent and visible to all participants through blockchain transactions.
   - No centralized authority controls the rewards; it is all managed by the smart contract.

### 5. **Withdraw Funds**
   - The contract owner can withdraw tokens from the contract, which is useful for unclaimed funds or in case of contract changes.
   - This function ensures that the owner can maintain control over the contractâ€™s token balance.

### 6. **Events for Tracking**
   - The contract emits events when a quiz is completed and when a reward is granted. This allows the frontend and other external services to listen for these events and track the state of the system.
